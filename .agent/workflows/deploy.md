description: Build and deploy the application to Firebase Hosting
---

This workflow will build the Next.js application as a static site and deploy it to the configured Firebase Hosting site.

1. Ensure you have the latest dependencies:
```powershell
npm install
```

2. Build and deploy in one command:
// turbo
```powershell
npm run deploy
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also run `npm run build` to verify the build locally before deploying.
